Please put the above values in a table in SQL so I can modify if require

Worker caps must be calculated per acre, not per estate.  So if you buy fine land and put a farm on it, the additional workers you could support are lost, they are not added to you estate (as the system currently does).  I hope this doesn't cause a major problem for you

Speaking of Esatate numbers, can you add 2 fields to the estate, a name and a Estate number.  Name the players can populate, estate number the admin will add.

Mobile version choose your character name aswell
